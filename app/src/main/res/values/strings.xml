    <!-- FAQ -->

    <string name="FAQ_Q2">How does the smart alarm work?</string>
    <string name="FAQ_A2">When the human body goes to sleep, it repeats multiple sleep cycles (or sleep stages) throughout the night. The best time to wake up is at light sleep stage, and it is statistically hard to land at this stage every time you wake up. Wethm uses vibrations to bring you to a light sleep stage, then wakes you up, making sure you feel great in the mornings.</string>
    <string name="FAQ_Q3">How does sleep induction work?</string>
    <string name="FAQ_A3">The sleep induction function uses vibrations to relax your body and mind, just as the gentle vibrations of a train carriage lulls you to sleep. To maximize the results, turn off all other devices and focus on the vibrations once you start the induction.</string>
    <string name="FAQ_Q4">What is Wethm Harmony</string>

    <string name="FAQ_Q6">Do I have to connect it to a watch to see the data?</string>
    <string name="FAQ_T6">• No, just lie down as you normally do.</string>
